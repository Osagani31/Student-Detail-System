# University Student Details System

A complete web application built using **Java JSP and Servlets** to store and manage student details, including their name, degree, and photo upload. The project also features **admin authentication** and **live search** by student name or degree.

This mini project was built to **sharpen my core Java web development skills** by implementing real-world concepts such as file handling, dynamic rendering, and secure backend logic ‚Äî all in a full-stack Java environment.
